    <h1>How to Use FlowGen</h1>
    <h2>Why FlowGen?</h2>
    <p>
        FlowGen is designed to help users easily create flowcharts without any complex software or prior experience. It solves the problem of spending too much time and effort to design simple flowcharts by providing an intuitive interface that generates a flowchart based on user input.
    </p>
    <h2>How to Use:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Enter text in the input field for each step of your flowchart.</li>
        <li>Select the desired action for your step:
            <ul>
                <li>Next Step: Creates a linear connection between the current step and the next step.</li>
                <li>Loop To: Connects the current step to a previous step in the flowchart, creating a loop.</li>
                <li>Choice: Creates a decision point with two outcomes, typically "Yes" and "No."</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Continue adding steps until your flowchart is complete.</li>
        <li>Click "Save as Image" to download your flowchart as a PNG image.</li>
        <li>Use the "Delete Node" button to remove the last added node in case of errors.</li>
    </ol>
